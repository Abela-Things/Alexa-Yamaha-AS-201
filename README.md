# Alexa-Yamaha-AS-201-remote

## Description
This Arduino Sketch creates 6 virtual Philips Hue lights that are detectable by Alexa. Each one of them when turned ON or OFF will send an IR code for a specific function of the Yamaha AS-201 Sound Amplifier

This code works for both ESP32 and ESP8266 on ArduinoIDE 1.8.16 with the latest versions available of AsyncTCP and ESPAsyncTCP on the 28th of march 2022.

You will need to change the Wifi SSID and password, and use the "search for devices" functionality of the Alexa App to set it up, the virtual device you create will appear as Philips Hue lights but you can program them to behave as anything other than a light through Alexa routines if needed.

## functionalities:

* Power On/OFF
* Line 1 input
* Line 2 input
* Phono input
* CD input
* Tuner input

## Wiring:
* IR Data to Pin 12

## Dependencies:
AsyncTCP for the ESP32
ESPAsyncTCP for the ESP8266
fauxmoESP for the Philips Hue emulation library
IRremote for the IR control library (used for emitting only here but is capable of both receiving and sending IR codes)

## Pour The B:
Un h√¥te qui se respecte se doit de servir le saucisson dans une saucissonette.
